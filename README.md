# the8agency

Run npm install on back and front folders to install all dependencies. <br/>
For the backend I used NodeJs, PostgreSQL and Sequelize. For the frontend I used Js and React. <br/>
Create a SQL Database called the8agency. <br/>
Run npm start on both folders to start the servers. The front server runs on port 3000 and the back server runs on port 8080. <br/>
The front was created with create-react-app. <br/>
When the browser is open in http://localhost3000, and each time that we refresh the browser, we can see in the console the attendees saved in the localstorage; 
when a new attendee is registered, we can see in the console the new data saved in localstorage. In the backend the form is saved in the database trougth an axios request from the frontend. The site is responsive.
